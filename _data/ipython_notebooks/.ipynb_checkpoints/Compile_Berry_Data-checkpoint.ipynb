Cell suppression was used to protect the cells that were determined to be sensitive to a disclosure of information.

The threshold rule was violated if the data cell contained less than three operations. For example, if only one farmer produced turkeys in a county, NASS could not publish the county total for turkey inventory without disclosing that individual\u2019s information. The dominance rule was violated if the distribution of the data within the cell allowed a data user to estimate any respondent\u2019s data too closely. For example, if there are many farmers producing turkeys in a county and some of them were large enough to dominate the cell total, NASS could not publish the county total for turkey inventory without risking disclosing an individual respondent\u2019s data. In both of these situations, the data were suppressed and a \u201c(D)\u201d was placed in the cell in the census publication table. These data cells were referred to as primary suppressions. "
